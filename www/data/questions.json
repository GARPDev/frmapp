  "question":"In October 1994, General Electric sold Kidder Peabody to Paine Webber, which eventually dismantled the firm.Which of the following led up to the sale?", 
  "reason":"Explanation: Kidder Peabody‚Äôs accounting system failed to account for the present value of forward trades, which allowed trader Joseph Jett to book an instant, but fraudulent, accounting profit by purchasing cash bonds to be delivered at a later date. These profits would dissipate as the bonds approached their delivery date, but Jett cov- ered this up by rolling the positions forward with increasingly greater positions and longer lengths to delivery,  which created a higher stream of hypothetical profits due to the accounting flaw. Finally this stream of large profits was investigated and Kidder Peabody was forced to take a USD 350 million accounting loss to reverse the reported gains, which resulted in a loss of confidence in the firm and General Electric‚Äôs subsequent sale.::::::::::::Section: Foundations of Risk Management::::::Reference: Steve Allen, Financial Risk Management: A Practitioner's Guide to Managing Market and Credit Risk::::::(New York: John Wiley & Sons, 2012), Chapter 4: Financial Disasters.::::::AIMS: Describe the key factors that led to and the lessons learned from the following risk management case::::::studies: Kidder Peabody.::::::::::::",

Which bank will estimate a higher value for the 1-day 99% VaR?::::::", 
  "reason":"Explanation: Many corporate bonds contain an embedded option that gives the issuer the right to buy the bonds back at a fixed price either in whole or in part prior to maturity. The feature is known as a call provision. The ability to retire debt before its scheduled maturity date is a valuable option for the issuer for which bondholders will demand compensation. All else being equal, this compensation will come in the form of bondholders paying a lower price for a callable bond than an otherwise identical option-free (i.e., straight) bond. The difference between the price of an option-free bond and the callable bond is the value of the embedded call option.::::::",

  "reason":"Explanation: This question tests the concept of subadditivity. With a subadditive risk measure, at any given confidence level, œÅ(A + B) ‚â§ œÅ(A) + œÅ(B), where œÅ reflects the portfolio risk.::::::::::::However, VaR is not a subadditive measure, which can be proved as follows: Assume that portfolio A and portfolio  B each represent a USD 100 position in a single bond with a 1-year default probability of 4% and a recovery rate of zero, with the default probabilities of A and B independent of each other. Therefore, the individual 95% VaR of each portfolio is zero. However, when analyzing the combined portfolio, the probability of no loss is (1-0.04)2, or 0.9216,  so the probability of one or more defaults is 1-0.9216, or 7.84%.

  "question":"A portfolio contains a long position in an option contract on a US Treasury bond. The option exhibits positive convexity across the entire range of potential returns for the underlying bond. This positive convexity:", 
  "reason":"Explanation: The relationship between convexity and volatility for a security can be seen most clearly through the second-order Taylor approximation of the change in price given a small change in yield. The resulting change in price can be estimated as:::::::::::::‚àÜùë∑ÔøΩ _::::::ùë∑‚âà ‚àí ÔøΩ‚àÜùíö+ ÔøΩ   ÔøΩ‚àÜùíöÔøΩ::::::::::::where d is equal to the duration, c is the convexity and y is the change in the interest rate. Since ‚àÜùíöÔøΩ is always posi- tive, positive convexity will lead to an increase in return as long as interest rates move, with larger interest moves in either direction leading to a greater return benefit from the positive convexity. Therefore, a position in a security with positive convexity can be considered a long position in volatility.::::::::::::This relationship can also be explained graphically. The price curve of a security with positive convexity will lie above and tangentially to the price curve of the underlying. If volatility of the underlying increases, then so will the volatility of either a long call or a long put, but the deviation from the price of the underlying will be positive when there is positive convexity, and negative with negative convexity. Therefore, the expected terminal value over the in-the-money region will increase while the expected terminal value over the out-of-the-money region will remain zero, an aggregate effect of increasing the total expected value of the option.::::::",
